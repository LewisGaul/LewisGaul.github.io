# CV of Lewis Gaul


## Employment

**Cisco Systems (formerly Ensoft)** (2018-present)
- Software Engineer (joined as graduate)
- Development in C, Python, Elm, Java


## Software Experience

**Python**
- I was introduced to Python in 2008 at the age of 13, and started playing around with problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) while I was studying for A levels.
- Throughout university I continued to practise using more complex Python techniques for various personal projects.
- My biggest personal project has been implementing an advanced version of the classic Minesweeper game (see [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/LewisGaul/minegauler)).
- I gave a 20-minute talk about my Minesweeper project at the Oxford science and technology conference *Inscite* in 2016.
- I taught an 8-week Python beginner's course to university students in 2017.
- I regularly use Python in my current job at Cisco.
- I have attended PyCon UK twice (2018 and 2019).
- I set up and ran [EnHackathon](https://enhackathon.github.io) in 2019.

**C**
- I was taught C when I joined Ensoft in 2018, and have worked on multiple teams with a C codebase in my time at Cisco/Ensoft.
- Some of my contribution to CPython has involved working with C code.

**Java**
- I wrote a basic Minesweeper Android app in 2016.
- At Cisco I worked on a project that was primarily written in Java, using the Drools rules engine.

**Elm**
- I took part in a week-long Elm course at Cisco.
- At Cisco I have created two internal web apps using Elm for the frontend and Python for the backend using the [EnTrance](https://github.com/ensoft/entrance) framework (one as part of a small team, another as an individual project).

**Web**
- I have some experience with setting up a web server (Apache, DNS configuration, SSL certificates).
- I have set up multiple sites hosted by GitHub pages (with Jekyll as the site generator).

**MATLAB**
- I used MATLAB at university for various projects, including my third- and fourth-year dissertations.

**Industry interest**
- I have a strong interest in programming languages and open source communities. Some examples:
  - I have been following development of the new programming language known as [*Jai*](https://github.com/BSVino/JaiPrimer/blob/master/JaiPrimer.md);
  - I keep up to date with the latest features and discussions in the Python and Elm communities;
  - I regularly watch videos of conference talks.

## Other Interests

**Sports**  
I'm a big tennis fan, and enjoy playing racket sports, especially tennis, squash and table tennis. I also enjoy cycle rides, especially with friends in the warmer periods of the year!

I spent four and a half months in Spain between the end of my degree and starting working at Ensoft to improve my ability to communicate in Spanish.
