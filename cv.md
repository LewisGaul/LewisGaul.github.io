## Software Experience

**Python**
- I was introduced to Python in 2008 at the age of 13, and started playing around with problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) while I was studying for A levels.
- Throughout university I continued to practise using more complex Python techniques for various personal projects.
- My biggest personal project has been implementing an advanced version of the classic Minesweeper game (see [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/LewisGaul/minegauler/tree/v4/dev)).
- I gave a 20-minute talk about my Minesweeper project at the Oxford science and technology conference *Inscite* in 2016.
- I taught an 8-week Python beginner's course to university students in 2017.
- I regularly use Python in my current job at Cisco.
- I have attended PyCon UK twice (2018 and 2019).
- I set up and ran [EnHackathon](https://enhackathon.github.io) in 2019.

**C**
- I was taught to program in C when I joined my job at Ensoft in 2018, and have worked on team with a codebase of primarily C code.
- Some of my contribution to CPython has involved reading and writing C code.
