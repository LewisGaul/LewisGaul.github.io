# Hi there, I'm Lewis!

More content will be coming soon, in the meantime check out my subpages:

[**CV**](./cv.html)  
More about my academic/software background.

[**EnHackathon**](https://enhackathon.github.io)  
This is an initiative to encourage people to contribute to open source Python that I started at work. The link above contains blog posts documenting people's experiences as first-time contributors.  
If you're interested in contributing to CPython but you're not sure where to get started I'd suggest first checking out [the devguide](https://devguide.python.org/). If you have questions or you get stuck take a look at [Where to get help](https://devguide.python.org/help/) - personally I'd recommend signing up to and sending an email on the [core-mentorship mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman3/lists/core-mentorship.python.org/).

[**Artwork site**](https://lewisgaul.co.uk/artwork-site)  
An early work-in-progress of a website to be used as a portfolio of artwork (not for me!).
