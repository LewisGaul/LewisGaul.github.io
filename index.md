# Hi there, I'm Lewis!

[**Blog**](./blog)  
Early days of a blog, with a heavy focus on software development!

[**Minegauler**](https://github.com/LewisGaul/minegauler)  
My biggest personal project by far - an open source implementation of Minesweeper with many added features, written in Python.

[**EnHackathon**](https://enhackathon.github.io)  
This is an initiative to encourage people to contribute to open source Python that I started at work. The link above contains blog posts documenting people's experiences as first-time contributors.
