  Someone pointed out to me that the header file in [Defining the
  API](https://www.lewisgaul.co.uk/blog/coding/2020/03/30/rust-python/#defining-the-api)
  isn't actually used programmatically in my example. That's not to say it
  serves no purpose (e.g. a C program wishing to implement the same API would be
  expected to `#include` it), but it would be good to get Rust to somehow verify
  that API functions are implemented with the correct signatures. If anyone has
  any further thoughts on this please let me know!
